/*****************************************************************/
/* inheritance - a superclass that can be extended to subclasses
that add or overwrite things
this to keep in mind
structure is around what it is: what is the class
data as well as methods, actions and functions that act upon that data
exL character class is going to have these properies and methods

problems: tight coupling -> fragile base class
because the base class changes all sublclasses
because of tight coupling it can break out code down the path

hierarchy problem: what if hierachy changes over tiem


compositons- using smaller pieces to create sometihng bigger
composed function to act upon data differently
focus and stcutre code:
around what it had and what it does to data
what the abilities are and what it is
 will help us create code that is more stable and eaiser to change in the future
